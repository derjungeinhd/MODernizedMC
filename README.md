# MODernized MC
_**A Tech & Adventure Modpack**_

Welcome to MODernized MC! This Modpack contains over 150 Mods that bring many old classics and new things to explore to the table. Explore a huge Overworld with many more biomes, strutures and loot, or venture out to the new dimensions and planets of the Modpack. Go down into the mines to find artifacts and a huge number of new ores! Build as many mashines and tools as possible to make your life easier and explore the world faster. Try some magic to summon new bosses and gain powerfull weapons, armor and potions. There is much to explore, but take your time and build a nice base with many of the new blocks. You don't need to rush your adventure!  

## Installation
**Please notice that I recommend using the [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) with this Modpack.**

To install and play the Modpack, download the newest Modpack Version on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/modernizedmc/versions) or in the Modrinth App. If you don't use the Modrinth App, [follow this guide](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth) to install the Modpack.
Then, you need to check the assigned RAM for the Modpack Instance. I currently recommend to allocate at least 8 GB of RAM, but mostly it takes up about 4 to 5 GB of RAM in my experience. Please look up how you change the allocated RAM an instance in your launcher. When finished, you are ready to go. But if you want, check and change the key binds and the mod configs as needed because I currently don't have a tested set of default configurations. 

For Servers, I recommend you to download the server variant of each version. The server variant is a stripped down version of the modpack, made for better compatibility and performance with servers. 
**NOTE: The server variant does _not_ contain any Mod which is not already present in the normal variant. Also, high server load is expected, don't expect your server to support very many players, regardless of the actual power of rig.**

## FAQ, Wiki and Issues...
...can all be found on the [Github Page of the MODernized MC Modpack](https://github.com/derjungeinhd/MODernizedMC). You can ask questions, report issues and request changes and additions there if you want! In the future, I may also organize a discord server but currently I don't see any need for it.

## A HUGE thanks...
...to all of the developers out there who helped to create such big Modpacks by publicly sharing their work on Minecraft Modding and reimaging Minecraft still after all this time. And especially a HUGE thank you to all the mod developers of the mods included in this Modpack and the Forge & NeoForge Teams. It wouldn't be that big or run at all without your work! <3
